# Solving AI with a deeply convoluted and nervous network

## Abstract
Here, we propose a novel approach to build an amazing AI using the so called DCNNs.

## Introduction


## Background



## Convoluted layers increase excitation of nervous networks

## One equation to rule them all
 
     $\theta_{k+1} = \theta_k - \gamma \nabla L(\theta_k) $

## Various tricks
### Learning rate
### Early stopping
### Gradient clipping
### Drop-out
### Weight decay
### Batch normalization
### Etc,...


## Conclusion
