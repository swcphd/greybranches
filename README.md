# greybranches

This repository is meant to serve the SWC Bootcamp Git Tutorial. You'll clone this repository and collaborate on it with the other teams. We'll walk you through how to commit and push local changes to the remote GitHub repository, and how to manage conflicts with the remote branch upon pulling from the remote. 

In the end, you'll craft a "distributed document" with the other teams.
